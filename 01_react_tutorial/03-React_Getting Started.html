    <h1>React Getting Started.</h1><hr/>


<!-- To use React in production, you need 'npm' and 'Node.js'

To get an overview of what React is, you can write React code 
directly in HTML. But in order to use React in production,
you need 'npm' and 'node.js' installed.


React Directly in HTML
=======================

The quickest way to start learning React is to write React directly in 
your HTML files.

Start by including three scripts, the first two let us write React 
code in our JavaScripts, and the third, Babel, allows us to write 
JSX syntax and ES6 in older browsers.

You will learn more about JSX in the React JSX chapter. -->

      <div id="mydiv"></div>

      <script type="text/babel">
         class Hello extends React.Component {
             render() {
                 return <h2>Hello World Again ! </h2>
             }
         }
         ReactDOM.render(<Hello/>, document.getElementById('mydiv'))
    </script>    


<!-- This way of using React can be OK for testing purposes, but for 
production you will need to set up a React environment.


Setting up a React Environment
===============================

If you have 'npm' and 'Node.js' installed, you can create a React 
application by first installing the 'create-react-app'.

Install create-react-app by running this command in your terminal:
___________________________________________________
C:\Users\Your Name>npm install -g create-react-app

Then you are able to create a React application, let's create one 
called 'myfirstreact'.

Run this command to create a React application named 'myfirstreact':
_____________________________________________________
C:\Users\Your Name>npx create-react-app myfirstreact

The create-react-app will set up everything you need to run a React
application.


Run the React Application
==========================

Run this command to move to the 'myfirstreact' directory:
__________________________________
C:\Users\Your Name>cd myfirstreact

Run this command to run the React application 'myfirstreact':
_________________________________________
C:\Users\Your Name\myfirstreact>npm start

A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App ! 
If not, open your browser and type localhost:3000 in the address bar.


Modify the React Application
=============================

So far so good, but how do I change the content ?

Look in the myfirstreact directory, and you will find a 'src' folder. 
Inside the 'src' folder there is a file called 'App.js', open it.
Try changing the HTML content and save the file.

Notice that the changes is visible immediately after you save 
the file, you do not have to reload the browser !                                 


Replace all the content inside the <div className="App"> 
with a <h1> element. See the changes in the browser when 
you click Save.                   
Notice that we have removed the imports we do not need 
(logo.svg and App.css).


What's Next ?
=============

Now you have a React Environment on your computer, and you are ready 
to learn more about React.

In the rest of this tutorial we will use our Show React tool 
to explain the various aspects of React, and how they are 
displayed in the browser.

If you want to follow the same steps on your computer, start by 
stripping down the src folder to only contain two files: index.js 
and index.html, in some builds you might find the index.html in the 
public folder instead, you should also remove any unnecessary lines 
of code inside the two files to make them look like the files in 
the Show React tool below:
