<!--
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React is used to build single page applications.
React allows us to create reusable UI components.


What You Should Already Know
=============================

Before starting with React.JS, you should have intermediate experience
in:
    > HTML
    > CSS
    > JavaScript

You should also have some experience with the new JavaScript features
introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), you will learn about them in the
React ES6 chapter.


Learning by Examples
======================

Our "Show React" tool makes it easy to demonstrate React,
it shows both the code and the result.


Create React App
=================

In order to learn and test React, you should set up a React Environment
on your computer.

This tutorial uses the 'create-react-app'. It is an officially
supported way to create React applications.

If you have 'npm' and 'Node.js' installed, you can create a React
application by first installing the 'create-react-app'.

Install 'create-react-app' by running this command in your terminal:
__________________________________________________
C:\Users\Your Name>npm install -g create-react-app


You are now ready to create your first React application !

Run this command to create a React application named 'myfirstreact':
____________________________________________________
C:\Users\Your Name>npx create-react-app myfirstreact

The 'create-react-app' will set up everything you need to run a React
application.

Note: This tutorial uses 'create-react-app' to demonstrate React
      examples. You will not be able to run the same examples on
      your computer if you  do not install the create-react-app
      environment.


Run the React Application
==========================

If you followed the two commands above, you are ready to run your
first real React application!

Run this command to move to the myfirstreact directory:
___________________________________
C:\Users\Your Name>cd myfirstreact

Run this command to execute the React application 'myfirstreact':
_________________________________________
C:\Users\Your Name\myfirstreact>npm start

A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App!
If not, open your browser and type localhost:3000 in the address bar.


You will learn more about the create-react-app in the React Get Started
chapter.                                                              -->
