<!-- What is React ?
=====================

React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook.
React is a tool for building UI components.


How does React Work ?
======================

"React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory".
------------------------------------------

Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates 
a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulations,
before making the changes in the browser DOM.

"React only changes what needs to be changed !"
-------------------------------------------------

React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs
to be changed. You will learn the various aspects of how React does this 
in the rest of this tutorial.
