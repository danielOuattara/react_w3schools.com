    <h1>React Components.</h1><hr/>

<!-- Components are like functions that return HTML elements.


React Components
=================

Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same 
purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and returns HTML 
via a render function.

Components come in two types:
  > Class components
  > Function components

In this tutorial we will concentrate on 'Class components'.


Create a Class Component
========================

When creating a React component, the component's name must start with 
an upper case letter.

The component has to include the 'extends React.Component' statement, 
which creates an inheritance to 'React.Component', and gives your 
component access to "React.Component's" functions.

The component also requires a 'render()' method, this method returns HTML.

Example: Create a Class component called Car                           
--------                                                              -->

    <script>

    class Car extends React.Component {

      render() {
         return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
      }
    }

    </script>


<!-- Now your React application has a component called Car, which returns 
a <h2> element.

To use this component in your application, use similar syntax as 
normal HTML: <Car />

Example: Display the Car component in the "place_Car" element:
-------                                                             -->
      <script>

         ReactDOM.render(<Car />, document.getElementById('place_Car'));

      </script>


<!-- Create a Function Component
=================================

Here is the same example as above, but created using 
a 'Function component' instead.

A 'Function component' also returns HTML, and behaves pretty much 
the same way as a 'Class component', but 'Class components' have 
some additions, and will be preferred in this tutorial.

Example: Create a Function component called Car2
--------                                                       -->
      <script>
         function Car2() {
            return <h2>Hi, I am also a Car!</h2>;
         }
        </script>


<!-- Once again your React application has a Car2 component.

Refer to the Car2 component as normal HTML (except in React, 
components must start with an upper case letter):

Example: Display the Car component in the "place_Car2" element:
--------                                                       -->


      <script>
         ReactDOM.render(<Car2 />, document.getElementById('place_Car2'));
      </script>


<!-- Component Constructor
===========================

If there is a 'constructor()' function in your component, this function
will be called when the component gets initiated.

The constructor function is where you initiate the component's 
properties.

In React, component's properties should be kept in an object called 'state'.

You will learn more about 'state' later in this tutorial.

The constructor function is also where you honor the inheritance of 
the parent component by including the 'super()' statement, which executes 
the parent component's constructor function, and your component has access 
to all the functions of the parent component (React.Component).


Example: Create a constructor function in the Car component, 
-------  and add a color property:


class Car3 extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {color: "Green"};
  }
  render() {
    return <h2>I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}
______________________________________________________________
 
 
Example: Use the color property in the render() function:
--------

class Car extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {color: "red"};
  }
  render() {
    return <h2>I am a {this.state.color} Car!</h2>;
  }
}
__________________________________________________________________ 


Props
==========

Another way of handling component properties is by using 'props'.
'Props' are like function arguments, and you send them into the 
component as attributes.You will learn more about props in the 
next chapter.

Example : Use an attribute to pass a color to the Car component, 
          and use it in the render() function:


class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>I am a {this.props.color} Car!</h2>;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Car color="red"/>, document.getElementById('root'));
_______________________________________________________________________
 

Components in Components
=========================

We can refer to components inside other components:

Example: Use the Car component inside the Garage component:
-------

class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}

class Garage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Who lives in my Garage?</h1>
        <Car />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Garage />, document.getElementById('root'));
_______________________________________________________________


Components in Files
=====================

React is all about re-using code, and it can be smart to insert some 
of your components in separate files.

To do that, create a new file with a ''.js' file extension and put 
the code inside it. 
Important: that the file must 'start' by importing React (as before), 
           and it has to 'end' with the statement 'export default Car';.


Example: This is the new file, we named it "App.js":
-------

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}

export default Car;
_____________________________________________________________________

To be able to use the Car component, you have to import the file in 
your application.

Example: Now we import the "App.js" file in the application, and we can
-------  use the Car component as if it was created here.

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Car from './App.js';

ReactDOM.render(<Car />, document.getElementById('root'));
