    <h1>React Lifecycle.</h1><hr/>


<!--Lifecycle of Components
============================

Each component in React has a 'lifecycle' which you can monitor and manipulate 
during its three main phases.

The three phases are: 
    A- 'Mounting', 
    B- 'Updating', 
    C- 'Unmounting'.


Mounting
=========

Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.

React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting 
a component:

1- 'constructor()
2- 'getDerivedStateFromProps()'
3- 'render()'
4- 'componentDidMount()'

The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional 
and will be called if you define them.


constructor() method
--------------------

The 'constructor()' method is called before anything else, when the component 
is initiated, and it is the natural place to set up the initial state and other 
initial values.

The 'constructor()' method is called with the props, as arguments, and you should 
always start by calling the 'super(props)' before anything else, this will initiate 
the parent's constructor method and allows the component to inherit methods from 
its parent (React.Component). 


Example: The constructor method is called, by React, every time you make a component: 
-------                                                                           -->

      <script>
          class Header extends React.Component {
              constructor (props) {
                  super(props);
                  this.state = {
                      color : "red",
                      fontSize : "15px",
                      backgroundColor : "rgb(20, 80, 220)"
                  }  
              }

              render () {
                  return(
                      <h2>My favorite color is {this.state.color} </h2>
                  );
              }
          }

          ReactDOM.render(<Header />, document.getElementById('root'));
      </script>


<!-- getDerivedStateFromProps() method
---------------------------------------

The 'getDerivedStateFromProps()' method is called right before rendering 
the element(s) in the DOM.

This is the natural place to set the 'state' object based on the initial 
'props'. It takes 'state' as an argument, and returns an object with 
changes to the 'state'.

The example below starts with the favorite color being "red", but 
the 'getDerivedStateFromProps()' method updates the favorite color 
based on the favcol attribute:                                        

Example: The 'getDerivedStateFromProps()' method is called right before the 
-------  render method:                                               -->

      <script>
          class Car extends React.Component {

              constructor(props) {
                  super(props);
                  this.state = {favoriteColor: "red"};
              }

              static getDerivedStateFromProps( props, state) {
                  return {favoriteColor: props.favColor};
              }

              render () {
                  return <h1> My favorite  car color is { this.favoriteColor }</h1>;
              }
          }

          ReactDOM.render(< Car favColor="Yellow" />, document.getElementById('root'));
      </script>



<!-- render() method
---------------------

The 'render()' method is required, and is the method that actual outputs HTML to the DOM.

Example: A simple component with a simple 'render()' method: 
--------                                                                           -->

      <script>
          class Header extends React.Component {

            render() {
                return (
                <h1>This is the content of the Header component</h1>
                );
            }
         }

           ReactDOM.render(<Header />, document.getElementById('root'));

      </script>


<!-- componentDidMount () method
---------------------------------

The 'componentDidMount()' method is called after the component is rendered.
This is where you run statements that requires that the component is already 
placed in the DOM.

Example: At first my favorite color is red, but 1 second later, it becomes 
-------  yellow instead:                                                   -->

      <script>
          class Header extends React.Component {
              constructor (props) {
                  super(props);
                  this.state = {
                      favoriteColor: "red",
                      padding : "20px"
                  }
              }

              render() {
                  return <h1> My favorite color is { this.state.favoriteColor} </h1>;
              }

              componentDidMount() {
                setTimeout( () => { this.setState({favoriteColor: "yellow"}) }, 1000 )

               }
           }

           ReactDOM.render(<Header />, document.getElementById('root'));

      </script>


<!-- Updating
==============

The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated.

A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.
React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component 
is updated:

 1-  'getDerivedStateFromProps()'
 2-  'shouldComponentUpdate()'
 3-  'render()'
 4-  'getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()'
 5-  'componentDidUpdate()'

The 'render()' method is required and will always be called, the others are optional 
and will be called if you define them.


getDerivedStateFromProps() method
----------------------------------

Also at updates the 'getDerivedStateFromProps()' method is called. This is the first 
method that is called when a component gets updated.
This is still the natural place to set the state object based on the initial props.

The example below has a button that changes the favorite color to blue, 
but since the 'getDerivedStateFromProps()' method is called, which updates 
the state with the color from the favcol attribute, the favorite color is 
rendered as yellow:

Example: If the component gets updated, the 'getDerivedStateFromProps()' method is called: 
--------                                                                                -->

      <script>
        class Header extends React.Component {
            constructor (props) {
                super(props);
                this.state = {
                 color: "Red",
                 padding : "20px"
                 }
             }

             changeColor = () => {
                this.setState({color: "Blue"});
             }

             static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
              return {color: props.otherColor};

            }

            render() {
               return (
                   <div>
                       <h1> My favorite color is { this.state.color} </h1>
                      <button type="button" onClick={ this.changeColor }>
                         Click to change color</button>
                     </div>
                );
            }   

        }

        ReactDOM.render(<Header otherColor="White" />, document.getElementById('root'));

      </script>


<!-- shouldComponentUpdate() method
-----------------------------------

In the 'shouldComponentUpdate()' method you can return a Boolean value that specifies 
whether React should continue with the rendering or not.

The default value is true.

The example below shows what happens when the shouldComponentUpdate() method
 returns false: 

Example: Stop the component from rendering at any update:
--------                                                                                -->

     <script>
         class Header extends React.Component {
            constructor (props) {
                super (props);
                this.state = {
                color: "Red",
                textAlign: "justify"
                };
            }

            shouldComponentUpdate () {
                return false;
            }

            changeColor = () => {
                this.setState ( {color: "Blue"});
            }

            render () {
                return (
                <div>
                    <h2> My favorite color is { this.state.color }</h2>
                    <button type="button" onClick={ this.changeColor } >Click to change</button>
                </div>
                );
            }
        }

 ReactDOM.render(<Header otherColor="White" />, document.getElementById('root'));



/* shouldComponentUpdate() method (true) (default) */

class Header extends React.Component {
  constructor (props) {
    super (props);
    this.state = {
      color: "Red",
      textAlign: "justify"
    };
  }

  shouldComponentUpdate () {
    return true;
  }

  changeColor = () => {
    this.setState ( {color: "Blue"});
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2> My favorite color is { this.state.color }</h2>
        <button type="button" onClick={ this.changeColor } >Click to change</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

 ReactDOM.render(<Header otherColor="White" />, document.getElementById('root'));


     </script>



<!-- render() method
-----------------------

The 'render()' method is of course called when a component gets updated, it has 
to re-render the HTML to the DOM, with the new changes.

The example below has a button that changes the favorite color to Blue: 

Example: Click the button to make a change in the component's state:
--------                                                                         -->

      <script>
          class Header extends React.Component {

                constructor(props) {
                    super(props);
                    this.state = {favoritecolor: "red"};
                }


                changeColor = () => {
                    this.setState({favoritecolor: "blue"});
                }

                render() {
                    return (
                    <div>
                    <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.favoritecolor}</h1>
                    <button type="button" onClick={this.changeColor}>Change color</button>
                    </div>
                    );
                }
          }

           ReactDOM.render(<Header />, document.getElementById('root'));
      </script>

<!-- getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method
--------------------------------------

In the 'getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()' method you have access to the props and state 
before the update, meaning that even after the update, you can check what the values 
were before the update.

If the 'getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()' method is present, you should also include 
the 'componentDidUpdate()' method, otherwise you will get an error.

The example below might seem complicated, but all it does is this:

 - When the component is mounting it is rendered with the favorite color "red".
 - When the component has been mounted, a timer changes the state, and after one 
   second, the favorite color becomes "yellow".

This action triggers the update phase, and since this component has a getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method, this method is executed, and writes a message to the empty DIV1 element.

Then the componentDidUpdate() method is executed and writes a message in the empty DIV2 element:

 
Example:

Use the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method to find out what the state object looked like before the update: -->

</body>
</html>
